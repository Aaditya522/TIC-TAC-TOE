# TIC-TAC-TOE
A simple yet engaging C++ implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project runs in the console and supports two players taking alternate turns. Players select positions on a 3x3 grid to place their respective markers ('X' or 'O'), aiming to align three markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
